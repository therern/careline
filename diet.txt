<h2> Introduction </h2>
<h3> 
In nutrition, diet is the sum of food consumed by a person or other organism. The word diet often implies the use of specific intake of 
nutrition for health or weight-management reasons (with the two often being related). Although humans are omnivores, each culture and each 
person holds some food preferences or some food taboos. This may be due to personal tastes or ethical reasons. Individual dietary choices 
may be more or less healthy. 
</h3>
<h3> 
Complete nutrition requires ingestion and absorption of vitamins, minerals, essential amino acids from protein and essential fatty acids 
from fat-containing food, also food energy in the form of carbohydrate, protein, and fat. Dietary habits and choices play a significant role 
in the quality of life, health and longevity.

<h2> Health Benefits </h2>
<h3> 
A healthy diet can improve and maintain health, which can include aspects of mental and physical health. Specific diets, such as the 
DASH diet, can be used in treatment and management of chronic conditions.

<h2> Dietary choices </h2>
<h3> 
Exclusionary diets are diets with certain groups or specific types of food avoided, either due to health considerations or by choice. Many 
do not eat food from animal sources to varying degrees (e.g. flexitarianism, pescetarianism, vegetarianism, veganism) for health reasons, 
issues surrounding morality, or to reduce their personal impact on the environment, although some of the public assumptions about which 
diets have lower impacts are known to be incorrect. People on a balanced vegetarian and vegan diet can get all necessary nutrients, 
but may need to specifically focus on consumption of nutrients like protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12. Raw foodism and 
intuitive eating are other approaches to dietary choices. Education, income, local availability, and mental health are all major 
factors for dietary choices.

<h2> Examples of Diets </h2>
<h2>
1. Atkins diet
</h2>
<h3>
The Atkins diet, or Atkins nutritional approach, focuses on controlling the levels of insulin in the body through a low-carbohydrate diet.
If people consume large amounts of refined carbohydrates, their insulin levels rise and fall rapidly. Rising insulin levels trigger the body 
to store energy from the food that is consumed, making it less likely that the body will use stored fat as a source of energy.
Therefore, people on the Atkins diet avoid carbohydrates but can eat as much protein and fat as they like.
Although popular for some time, the Atkins Diet comes with certain risks. Individuals considering the Atkins Diet should speak with their doctor.

<h2>
2. Ketogenic diet
</h2>
<h3>
The ketogenic diet has been used for decades as a treatment for epilepsy and is also being explored for other uses. It involves reducing carbohydrate 
intake and upping fat intake. It sounds contrary to common sense, but it allows the body to burn fat as a fuel, rather than carbohydrates.
Healthy fats, such as those in avocados, coconuts, Brazil nuts, seeds, oily fish, and olive oil are liberally added to the diet to maintain an overall emphasis on fat.
The diet causes the break down of fat deposits for fuel and creates substances called ketones through a process called ketosis. This diet has risks including ketoacidosis 
for people with type 1 diabetes, however, and may result in diabetic coma and death. Although most studies are 2 years or less, there is some promising research in relation 
to diabetes management, metabolic health, weight loss, and body composition change.

<h2>
2. Vegan diet
</h2>
<h3>
Veganism is more of a way of life and a philosophy than a diet. A vegan does not eat anything that is animal-based, including eggs, dairy, and honey. 
Vegans do not usually adopt veganism just for health reasons, but also for environmental, ethical, and compassionate reasons.
Vegans believe that modern intensive farming methods are bad for our environment and unsustainable in the long-term. If everybody ate plant-based food, 
the environment would benefit, animals would suffer less, more food would be produced, and people would generally enjoy better physical and mental health, vegans say.
